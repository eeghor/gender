gender
=======================================

Get gender from name and email address

What does it do?
----------------

Suppose you have someone's name and need to find out whether this person is a female (male). The name might come with an email address as it's often the case when you deal with customer records. This package does just that.

Key Advantages
--------------

- Very simple to use
- Accepts a single string or a list of strings as input
- Relies on a dataset of 130,000+ unique names
- Covers hypocorisms (English only at this time)
- Makes use of a person’s email address (if available) via searching for names and grammatical gender words in the prefix
- Doesn’t care if the input has bad formatting
